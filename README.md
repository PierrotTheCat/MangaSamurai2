<h1>Inspiration</h1>
I love the Amazon Kindle Guided View, which zooms into interesting parts of the pages of graphic novels (mangas and comics). It provides a cinematic reading experience and highlights details that can be easily overlooked on small displays. 

Therefore I tried to make a similar automated feature that can be universally applied.

<h1>How to use</h1>

<h2>Detailed Instructions</h2>
- save the graphic novel pages you want to cut as .jpg or .png files in a folder on your Android smartphone or tablet
  - make sure the names of the pages look like this: 001.jpg, 002.jpg,...
- download and install the apk
- start the app
- tap on the three dot menu in the top right corner
- tap on "choose folder"
- navigate the folder picker dialogue until you've found the folder with the graphic novel pages and confirm your choice
- wait until the loading circle is gone (cutting finished)
- tap the display to show the first panel

<h2>Controls</h2>
- show next panel: tap on the display
- show previous panel: long tap on the display
- show new graphic novel: tap the three dot menu, tap on "choose folder", choose a different folder

<h1>Notes</h1>
- No graphic novel pages are included
- all graphic novel pages in the folder are sorted and cut in the order of their file names
  - make sure the names of the pages look like this: 001.jpg, 002.jpg,...
