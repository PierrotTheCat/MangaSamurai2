<h1>Inspiration</h1>
I love the Amazon Kindle Guided View, which zooms into interesting parts of the pages of graphic novels (mangas and comics). It provides a cinematic reading experience and highlights details that can be easily overlooked on small displays but it is limited to selected series. </n></n>
Therefore I tried to make a similar automated feature that can be universally applied.

<h1>How to use</h1>

<h2>Detailed Instructions</h2>
<ul>
<li>save the graphic novel pages you want to cut as .jpg or .png files in a folder on your Android smartphone or tablet</li>
<li>make sure the names of the pages look like this: 001.jpg, 002.jpg,...</li>
<li>download and install the apk, if you haven't already</li>
<li>start the app</li>
<li>tap on the three dot menu in the top right corner</li>
<li>tap on "choose folder"</li>
<li>navigate the folder picker dialogue until you've found the folder with the graphic novel pages and confirm your choice</li>
<li>wait until the loading circle is gone (cutting finished)</li>
<li>tap the display to show the first panel</li>
</ul>

<h2>Controls</h2>
<ul>
  <li>show new graphic novel/chapter: tap on the three dot menu, tap on "choose folder", choose a different folder, wait, tap to show first panel</li>
