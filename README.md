<h1>Inspiration</h1>
I love the Amazon Kindle Guided View, which zooms into interesting parts of the pages of graphic novels (mangas and comics). It provides a cinematic reading experience and highlights details that can be easily overlooked on small displays but it is limited to selected series. </n></n>
Therefore I tried to make a similar automated feature that can be universally applied und helps avoid page-wide spoilers.</n></n>
My app aditionally features an automatic reading mode that displays the next panel after a dynamic amount of time, depending on the size and shape of the panel.

<h1>How to use</h1>

<h2>Controls and Features</h2>
<ul>
  <li>show new graphic novel/chapter: tap on the three dot menu, tap on "choose folder", choose a different folder, wait, tap to show first panel</li>
  <li>show next panel: tap on the display
  <li>return to previous panel: long press on panel</li>
  <li>zooming panel: pinching gesture or double tap</li>
  <li>move panel: drag and drop</li>
  <li>automatic reading mode: start it over the menu to change the panel automatically and dynamically every 6 - 22 seconds depending on the panel shape and size, tap the same menu item to stop, other controls still work during this mode</li>
  <li>dynamic color: theme adapts to your Material You color scheme</li>
  <li>color filter overlay: open the menu, tap on color filter, adjust the argb values, save and tap on the panel to apply the color overlay</li>

</ul>
